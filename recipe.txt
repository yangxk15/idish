Roast Duck
With just a few hours' roasting and hardly any work at all, you can have a juicy bird with crisp skin—the best of both textures.

Long Island duck,5- to 6-lb
boiling-hot water,2 cups
kosher salt,1 tablespoon
black pepper,1 teaspoon
3
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F.
If necessary, cut off wing tips with poultry shears or a sharp knife. Remove and discard excess fat from body cavity and neck, then rinse duck inside and out. Prick skin all over with a sharp fork. Fold neck skin under body, then put duck, breast side up, on a rack in a 13- by 9- by 3-inch roasting pan and pour boiling-hot water over duck (to tighten skin). Cool duck, then pour out any water from cavity into pan. Pat duck dry inside and out, reserving water in pan, then rub duck inside and out with kosher salt and pepper.
Roast duck, breast side up, 45 minutes, then remove from oven. Turn duck over using 2 wooden spoons, and roast 45 minutes more. Turn duck over again (breast side up), tilting duck to drain any liquid from cavity into pan. Continue to roast duck until skin is brown and crisp, about 45 minutes more (total roasting time: about 2 1/4 hours). Tilt duck to drain any more liquid from cavity into pan. Transfer duck to a cutting board and let stand 15 minutes before carving. Discard liquid in roasting pan.

French Toast
A rich, puffy outer crust makes this baked French toast recipe well worth the time to prepare it! Use country-style bread, challah, or baguette slices.

Unsalted butter,1/2 cup
Half-and-half cream,1 1/2 cups
Slices French bread,6 (1-inch thick) 
Eggs,5

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Mix in brown sugar and corn syrup, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Remove crusts from bread, and arrange in the baking dish in a single layer. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, half and half, vanilla extract, orange brandy, and salt. Pour over the bread. Cover, and chill at least 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove the dish from the refrigerator, and bring to room temperature. Bake uncovered 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until puffed and lightly browned.

Macaron
Lovely, light little French almond meringue cookies are just begging to be filled with your favorite filling and made into sandwiches for a delightful treat.

Egg,3
White sugar,1/4 cup
Confectioners' sugar,1 2/3 cups
finely ground almond,1 cup 
3
Beat egg whites in the bowl; beat in white sugar until egg whites are glossy. Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a bowl and fold the mixture into the egg whites. Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold the batter a few more times and retest.
When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let the piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C). Bake cookies until set but not browned, about 10 minutes; let cookies cool completely before filling.

Preheat grill for low heat and lightly oil the grate. Cut baguette on a severely sharp diagonal to make 4 long slices about 1/2-inch thick.

Rub each side of baguette slices with the cut-side of garlic and cut-side of tomatoes. Set aside to cool.
Brush 2 cut sides of romaine quarters with remaining olive oil. Grill romaine quarters until lightly seared, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Sprinkle grilled romaine with salt and set aside to cool.
Place a grilled romaine quarter, cut-side up, on top of a grilled baguette slice. Drizzle each with Caesar dressing and top with Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and black pepper.
